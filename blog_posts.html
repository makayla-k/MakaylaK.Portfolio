					<h5>This past May I graduated with my Bachelors in Computer Science!</h5>
					<p>
						 It was quite a journey to make it to gradution. Back in 2019 I joined a Computer Science cohort program that basically took over my life for three years. I was taking an average of 18 units a semester, I was cross enrolled between a community college and a CSU, every summer and winter I took classes, I participated in extracurriculars that were apart of the cohorts requirements, and to prepare myself for life after college I did everything I could to make myself a well rounded engineer.
					</p>
					<p>
						I worked on open source projects, took mobile app development courses, built my own website to show as my portfolio, I even worked part-time as a TA. A month or two before graduation a part of me felt relieved and proud that I could Finally say <strong>"I did it!"</strong> but then the real worry started to set in. <strong>I had no job offers</strong>. Unlike my classmates who had previous internship experience and more than likely had a return offer for a big tech company, I did not know where my career even started.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>
				During my last semester of college I worked as a TA for a Non-profit, CodePath. I particularly enjoyed working as a TA because it allowed me to share my knowledge and experience with other students as well as strengthening my skills as an engineer. I was only contracted to work with CodePath till the end of the semester and I knew that I would soon have to find a full time job elsewhere.
			</p>
			<div class="p-2" style=" display:inline-flex; text-align:left;">
				<div style="padding-right: 2%;">
					<p>
						I was extremely worried and overwhelmed. I worked so hard to get my degree and it still felt like it wasn't enough. I was completely filled with <strong>imposter syndrome</strong> that I wouldn't be given an opportunity after college. But little did I know that CodePath's TA position would open huge doors for me!
					</p>
					<p>
						I was contracted to work with <strong>META</strong>! Being blessed with this opportunity gave me the confidence that I am a capable engineer! Being a woman and a minority in tech it is so easy to face imposter syndrome and have doubts. I remember constantly comparing myself to my male classmates but the thing I had to remember was that even though I may work and process things differently from others, it does not mean that my skills do not have value.
					</p>
					<p>
						If I could go back to and tell myself one thing it would be to take advantage of every opportunity that comes your way and <strong>never belittle yourself</strong>. This was just the beginning of my career and I am forever grateful for this opportunity!
